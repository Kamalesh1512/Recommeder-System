Movie Recommender System (content Based)

Main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the from user him or herself.

The algorithm recommends movies that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. 
This similarity (generally cosine similarity) is computed from the data we have about the items as well as the userâ€™s past preferences.
