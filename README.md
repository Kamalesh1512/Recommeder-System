# Recommeder-System
Movie Recommender System (content Based)

Main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.

The algorithm recommends movies that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past.
This similarity (generally cosine similarity) is computed from the data we have about the items as well as the userâ€™s past preferences.

Project Flow:
Data collection --> Data Preprocessiong --> Model Building --> Website -->deployment
